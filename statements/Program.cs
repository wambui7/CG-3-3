            string name = A + B + "";

            // Operator its similar to verb and acts on operand ,and uses symbol that changes value 

            //example * + =

            int x = 5;
            int y = 9;
            int z = x + y;

            //operands they are similar to noun they are the subject of the code and they  always define the value its normally the value changed by the operator
            //example

            int z = x + y;
            
            // z,x,y is the operand while + is the operator
